You are an expert Python software engineer and a master debugger. Your task is to fix a critical syntax error in a Python script.

The script failed with a SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal. This means a multi-line string that started with triple quotes was not correctly closed.

Analyze the provided Python script and the error log. Pay very close attention to the line numbers mentioned in the error. Your goal is to provide a fully corrected version of the script that is syntactically valid and ready to run.

COMMON CAUSES FOR THIS ERROR:
* A multi-line string is missing its closing triple quotes.
* The string content itself contains a triple-quote sequence, which needs to be escaped (e.g., by breaking it up like '""' + '"' or using '\"\"\"').
* An unclosed parenthesis or bracket before the string, causing the parser to get confused.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Your response MUST contain ONLY the full, corrected Python script.
2.  Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or markdown formatting like ```python.
3.  Scrutinize every multi-line string in the file to ensure it is properly terminated.

The script you are debugging is a comprehensive Python program designed to fully automate the creation and deployment of a modern, multi-page website. Its goal is to take a company name, domain, and industry as input and produce a live, functional website without manual intervention.

The agents workflow is as follows:

Project Scaffolding: It begins by creating a new Next.js (a React framework) project using pnpm, which sets up the fundamental file structure.

AI Content Generation: It makes two calls to the Google Gemini API:

The first call requests detailed website content (headlines, paragraphs, FAQ items, etc.) for six pages, structured as a JSON object.

The second call requests a custom color theme (CSS variables) based on the companys industry.

Image Integration: It calls the Pexels API to fetch a gallery of real, high-quality images related to the specified industry.

File Assembly: The agent then writes all the necessary files. It injects the AI-generated content and Pexels image URLs into pre-defined React component templates (.tsx files) for each page. It also writes the custom CSS theme into the global stylesheet.

Build and Deploy: Finally, it runs the Next.js build process to compile the application into an optimized production version. It then uses rsync and ssh to transfer the files to the remote server and runs a provisioning script to make the website live.

You can view the full script in the Canvas under the ID ai_site_agent_fix_03.

Definition of a Successful Run
A successful run is when the agent completes the entire workflow from start to finish without any script errors (i.e., an exit code of 0).

The definitive sign of success is the final line in the output log:
[üéâ] Deployment to https://{{domain}} complete!

When you see this message, it means the debugger can stop. The agent has successfully generated all content, assembled the website files, built the application, and deployed it to the live domain provided.

Environment and Dependencies
The agent operates in a specific environment with several key components:

Programming Language: The core agent script is written in Python 3.

Python Libraries: It uses the standard subprocess, pathlib, and json libraries, along with the requests library for making API calls.

Project Dependencies: The website it generates relies on a Node.js environment and uses pnpm as its package manager. Key libraries it installs for the website include:

next

react

tailwindcss

@mui/icons-material

@heroicons/react

System Tools: The agents execution environment requires access to the following command-line tools: pnpx, pnpm, rsync, and ssh.
